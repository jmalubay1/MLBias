Objective

For this term project, we are going to use unsupervised machine learning models to find potential racial bias correlations among criminal record datasets with a main goal of identifying and quantifying bias in the dataset. We will also examine and compare the results between the same criminal record dataset that have race labeled and without race labeled with an additional goal of visualizing potential disparities.

Approach

We will first reimplement the cleaning of the dataset as described by propublica in their paper’s “methodology” report in preparation for modeling it. We will then select an appropriate ML model and implement it to group the data e.g. K-means Clustering, auto-encoder etc. Once grouped with can compare clusters and choose ways to visualize them to show any disparities we find in the groupings.
	
Team Structure
Because of the size of each individual task, we plan to share in the implementation as evenly as possible however we have each assigned ourselves an area to research and take point on.

Milestones
Reimplement Propublica’s data filtering for a balanced dataset
Implement 1 or potentially more ML models around the data
Provide clear evidence of known bias (main objective)
Create visualizations that simply and effectively show bias
Find evidence of potential causes for bias and/or attempt to counter bias
